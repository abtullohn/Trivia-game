Hello everyone! Welcome to your Below Average Trivia game.
The reason why I picked this game is because it is one of my favorite games to play in a group setting! The theme for this trivia will be POTATOES. I dont know about you guys but through 3 weeks of this cohort I personally feel like a potato.

```js
function setNextQuestion() {
  resetState()
  showQuestion(shuffledQuestions[currentQuestionIndex])
}
  

```
The technologies that i've used to make this game possible is JS,HTML and CSS.
Throughout this project I am most proud of is using resetState(). What this function does is that it re-renders the code to update it.
